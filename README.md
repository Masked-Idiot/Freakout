# Freakout
The FreakC package manager, written in FreakC!

# Installation
You can either clone this repository:
<code>
     git clone https://github.com/Masked-Idiot/Freakout.git
</code>
Or you can download the code for it and either recompile it using FreakC or just put the .bat file in your path
You absolutely NEED git installed for this package manager to work because i didn't feel like using cURL
